# P: Create subset project from single-datasets (subset-project)

## Brief description
Sub-select individual datasets into a subset so that certain analyses can be performed only on the specified set of datasets. Subsets are distinct from merge datasets and can be used in parallel with them.

## Parameters
### **Subset of datasets** (`type` - array)

Subset of datasets selected for annotation..

### **Subset name** (`type` - string)

Name to be given to the subset of datasets.

|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple allowed                  | True    | Allow multiple instances of this task in a workflow.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Task can fail                     | False   | Task is optional and can fail without causing the entire workflow to fail.                                                                                                                               |
| Step can fail                     | True    | Sub-tasks of this task can fail without causing the entire task (and workflow) to fail.                                                                                                                  |
| Requires ion mobility             | False   | Task requires ion mobility data.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Task can fail (with ion mobility) | False   | This task uses ion mobility data but it is allowed to fail, without causing the entire workflow to fail.                                                                                                 |
| Allowed in reference dataset      | True    | Task is to be performed on a 'reference' dataset. This will allow for multiple analyses to be performed on the same dataset, without cluttering or duplicating certain tasks (**unused at the moment**). |

# P: Skyline mass spectrum (single-dataset)

## Brief description
Generate skyline mass spectrum based on fraction of the pixels. Rather than summing or averaging pixel intensities, this task will use the maximum intensity for each m/z.

## Parameters
### **Filename** (`type` - string)

Filename to use for the object. This can be very helpful when you want to e.g. compare or export spectra

### **Proportion** (`type` - number)

Proportion of pixels to use for the task.

### **Normalization tag** (`type` - string)

Tag to use for normalization.

!!! help
    Rather than applying a normalization to the entire dataset, we apply it as needed to each task at hand.<br> You can compare the effect normalization has on specific task by repeating it with different normalization.<br> In some cases, its advised to use 'multi-dataset' normalization, in particular when doing comparisons.
### **Normalization name** (`type` - string)

Name of the normalization.

| Multiple allowed                  | True    | Allow multiple instances of this task in a workflow.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Task can fail                     | False   | Task is optional and can fail without causing the entire workflow to fail.                                                                                                                               |
| Step can fail                     | False   | Sub-tasks of this task can fail without causing the entire task (and workflow) to fail.                                                                                                                  |
| Requires ion mobility             | False   | Task requires ion mobility data.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Task can fail (with ion mobility) | False   | This task uses ion mobility data but it is allowed to fail, without causing the entire workflow to fail.                                                                                                 |
| Allowed in reference dataset      | True    | Task is to be performed on a 'reference' dataset. This will allow for multiple analyses to be performed on the same dataset, without cluttering or duplicating certain tasks (**unused at the moment**). |

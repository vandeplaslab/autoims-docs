## Description

This task is not really a task but rather a way for us to know who the data belongs to.

You can provide your `name`, `slack user id` and `email`. 

This information will be used to contact you once data processing has finished or if there were some issues.

You will be notified in the `Team Spraggins` workspace, in the `#autoims-progress` channel.

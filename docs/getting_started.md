# Getting started

## Folder structure

All data must live within the **DELFT** folder, and then within you own folder.

```
DELFT
|
├── lgmigas
    |
    ├── config.json
    ├── extras
    ├── raw
    │   ├── dataset_1.d
    │   ├── dataset_2.d
    │   └── dataset_X.d
    └── tags.csv
```


## Using Windows Explorer/Finder

Here are some basic steps:
1. Inside the **DELFT** folder, please create your directory (e.g. for me, this would be **lgmigas**).
2. Inside that folder, add the name of your project (e.g. **kidney_matrix_pos**)
3. Inside that folder, you create folder **raw** where you would paste your raw data (e.g. Bruker .d)
4. Then you can use the AutoIMS App to generate your configuration.


## Using the app

1. Open the AutoIMS app.
2. Click on the `Select project directory` button.
3. Select directory within the **DELFT** folder.
4. Create your new project folder (e.g. **kidney_matrix_pos**) as above.
5. Click on the `Create template directory...` button.
6. TA-DA! The folder was pre-populated with a few files.

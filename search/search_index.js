Iterate over number of components/clusters boolean Test several number of clusters ranging from 3 to the value defined in the 'Number of components/clusters'. Number of components/clusters [all] integer Number of components to use.  If the value is 0, number of components will be identical to the number of features. '0' can only be used for PCA and NMF.
